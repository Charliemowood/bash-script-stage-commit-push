# Bash script

This is a simple and imperfect bash script for helping automate staging, committing and pushing to git. 

## Suggestions

1. Run the following on the file to give it root permissions, otherwise you will to be root or use sudo to run the script. 
```bash
chmod +x git.sh
```

2. For usage only on your user and so you can run the script from any directory but the script in ~/repository. 
```bash
mv git.sh ~/.bin
```

3. To evoke the script. 
```bash
git.sh
```
